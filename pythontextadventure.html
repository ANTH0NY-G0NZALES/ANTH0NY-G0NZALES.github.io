        <h2>Written Response</h2>
        <p>
            The diffculty I encountered at two parts of the development program was when I would enter in a choice and nothing would happen. 
            For example I would enter in the letter y or n so I can get to a new stage but in the replit nothing would happen I would just be stuck.
            It was so frustrating but I was able to resolve it by carefully going back and seeing if I misspelled words or if I didn't put it in the state machine. 
            Another problem I had was being organized because whenever I load the code all I see is letters and coding so I have to be organized by denting properly and looking at the 
            colors of the text to see which goes where, it's like a pattern I have to follow to be neat. I was able to resolve all of this by
            staying in Mr. Landfried's Zoom calls listening to what the other student's had problems with because I had the same ones so when the students
            were asking the questions I was resolving them while Mr. Landfried was showing them how to fix it.
