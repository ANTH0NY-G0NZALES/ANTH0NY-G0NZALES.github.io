        Someone might have to intervene.

    <h2> Why though? </h2>

    <body>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm going to tell you what you <b>NEED</b> to hear not what you <b>WANT</b> to hear.</li>
            <li><i>Coronavirus</i> Pandemic hit everyone out of nowhere.</li>
            <ol>
                <li>We need to take this time to <b>reevaluate</b> what we've been doing with our lives and prepare for a event like this.</li>
                <li>Honestly let's be real everyone is either frustrated or depressed.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li> <p>In my opinion life is about <b>growing</b>, if you didn't at least <b><i>learned</i></b> something during quarantine, <b><i>YOU</i></b> wasted it or let me say you indulged in free time which is okay if that's 
            what you want to do, nothing is stopping you. <b>Your life, your choice</b>, I'm just trying to give <b><i>free</i></b> game. </p> </li>
            <li>Self Discipline is fundamental to living a great life, DM me a successful person who lacked self dicipline, I'll wait. </li>
            <li>Everyone should have the feeling that they have purpose in their life, we were born to be <i>righteous</i>. </li>
        </ul>

<h2> Why trust me? </h2>
    <body>
        <ol>
            <li>You don't have to, you can simply leave my website, take information I regurgitated from self-improvement channels on YT, <b>(LINK UNDER CONSTRUCTION)</b> 
            and try it yourself and see how you feel.</li>
            <li>Again I'm speaking from experience which could appear as baby steps to others but some people don't have the right mindset and that was me before this pandemic.</li>
            </li>
            <li>
            People always tell me I've changed, well yeah what are you supposed to do in life? Sit on the couch 24/7?
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li> I am open to any discussion, if you have any argument towards me I'll like to hear it so we can come to a agreement </li>
                <li> From experience my mental and physical state has changed for the better.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>I believe in Karma, If I know information that can help others why can't I share it through coding? I'm killing two birds with one stone. </li>
            <li>In my opinion our society is messed up and I believe that we were born to fix the corruption going on around the world whether that is the environment or politics.
             </li>
        </ol>
