        <h3> All my homies hate <i>coronavirus.</i> <br>
        Hi my name is <i>Anthony</i> and I'm trying to master a new skill which is coding
        since I heard it's a good skill to have. <br> </h4>

                <h1> Career Goal: </h1>
                <p>One of my personal career goals of mine is majoring in computer science. We live
                 in a world where technology is further growing and expanding to 
                 shape our future. I have always been curious to learn new things 
                 about technology, specifically software engineering or computer 
                 science engineering. I plan to finish my computer science classes
                 in high school and then move on to further studies in college. This
                 is my career choice because for one, I like using technology and 
                 learning about it, and two, it makes some serious cash, so it was
                 an obvious choice.

                <h1> Strengths and personal qualities:</h1>
                <p>Some characteristics I would use to describe myself is being 
                ambitious and doing some risk-taking. Games for example, you start out not 
                knowing what to do. So, you learn the game and practice over and over until 
                you get it. I am a natural leader. In the years that I was a game overview 
                manager, I managed development and got things done through communication and 
                proper time management. I am pretty friendly and reliable, so I make a good 
                team member.</p>

                <h1> Your abilities and work skills: </h1>
                <p>
                                    A major achievement in high school so far is learning to be open-minded and accurate.
                    From these experiences, I’ve learned to develop new skills for myself to be able to adapt
                    to my surroundings and work. This helped me very much because I thought I could never 
                    learn new things without getting through the task at hand. Through my work experience,
                    I’ve found out how to work efficiently and creatively.
